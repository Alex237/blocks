## How to use them?
<hr>

In your style add a path to it, like this:

```yaml
import:
    - http://tangrams.github.io/blocks/filter/grain.yaml
```

Then ```mix``` it with your custom styles like this:

```yaml
styles:
    buildings:
        base: polygons
        mix: [filter-grain]
```

This will add all the functions defined on that **Tangram Block** to your current custom style (in this case ```buildings```). Note that some of this modules have some values on the ```defines``` that can be tweaked. For example in the above example we can increase the detail and amount of the grain by modifying this two defines:

```yaml
styles:
    buildings:
        base: polygons
        mix: [filter-grain]
        shaders:
            defines:
                GRAIN_AMOUNT: .4
                NUM_OCTAVES: 3
```
